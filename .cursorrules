# Project: MicroBatch - Micro-bakery Production Management

## Communication Style
- The user is not a coder - always explain changes in simple, everyday English
- Avoid technical jargon when possible
- When technical terms are necessary, explain them simply
- Always explain WHAT you changed and WHY you changed it
- Break down complex changes into simple bullet points

## Styling Rules
- **ALWAYS use Tailwind CSS for ALL styling** - never use regular CSS files or inline styles
- This project uses Tailwind CSS v4
- Use the existing design system colors: `bg-background`, `bg-surface`, `text-text-primary`, `text-text-secondary`, `text-accent`, `border-border`
- Follow the existing component patterns in `src/components/ui/` for consistency
- The project uses Radix UI components with Tailwind styling

## Navigation Menu Rules
- **CRITICAL: When adding ANY new feature or main page, you MUST automatically add it to the navigation menu**
- The navigation menu is located in: `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx`
- The menu items are defined in the `navItems` array (around line 18-25)
- Each navigation item needs:
  - `label`: The display name (e.g., "Recipes")
  - `href`: The URL path (e.g., "/recipes")
  - `icon`: An icon from lucide-react (import it at the top of the file)
- Example of adding a new menu item:
  ```typescript
  { label: "New Feature", href: "/new-feature", icon: IconName }
  ```
- Always pick an appropriate icon that represents the feature
- Add new items in a logical order (before Settings, which should stay last)

## Project Structure
- This is a Next.js 16 app with TypeScript
- Pages go in: `src/app/[feature-name]/page.tsx`
- Reusable components go in: `src/components/[feature-name]/`
- UI components (buttons, cards, etc.) go in: `src/components/ui/`
- Database schema is in: `src/lib/db/schema.ts` (uses Drizzle ORM)
- The layout file is: `src/app/layout.tsx`

## Current Features
The app currently has these main sections:
- Home (dashboard/overview)
- Recipes (managing bakery recipes)
- Orders (customer orders)
- Production (batch production runs)
- Pantry (ingredients, pans, packaging inventory)
- Settings (app configuration)

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Use "use client" directive for components that need interactivity (buttons, forms, etc.)
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep code simple and well-organized
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## When Creating New Features
1. Create the page file in the appropriate `src/app/` folder
2. **Immediately add the feature to the navigation menu** in `sidebar-nav.tsx`
3. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
4. Follow the existing component structure
5. Explain to the user in simple terms what you created and where to find it

## Summary for AI
Every time you make changes:
1. Use Tailwind CSS (never regular CSS)
2. Explain changes in plain English
3. If you add a new main feature/page, automatically update the navigation menu
4. Tell the user exactly what you did and where the files are located
